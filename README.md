Our project is about Photonics chips for machine learning
Using photonic chips can be safer when transfer signals and can be faster than electrical chips. It can also have large communication capacity, long distance transmission, anti-electromagnetic interference etc... And also it can reduce the costing in chips and use in robot, PC etc... As the result, photonic chips are useful in machine learning. 
I choose lighton company do this area and they have some opensource in GitHub. Their license is MIT license. 
In Lighton, there are some use cases we can choose to simulate it. They have Machine Learning techniques, computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, ranking and recommendations, time series and machine intelligence. 
My goal is to simulate a product that belongs to machine learning with photonic chips. And I can use opensource to simulate it. Lighton has a project about Tacking Reinforcement Learning with the Aurora OPU: playing Pac-man. They put opensource on GitHub and I think I can use these to simulate these.
